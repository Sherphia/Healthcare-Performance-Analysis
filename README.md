## 📊 Dataset Used  
**Patient Satisfaction Score – 2024 Quarterly Data**

| Quarter | Score |
|---------|--------|

## 📈 Data Visualization  
The Python script (`analysis.py`) generates a line chart showing:

- Quarterly satisfaction trend  
- A benchmark line at **4.5** for comparison  
- A steep performance drop in **Q3**  
- Recovery in Q4, but still not stable  

The generated file:  
`patient_satisfaction.png`

## 🔍 Key Findings  

### 1. **Strong performance in Q1 and Q2**  
The company performed above target (4.5), reaching **5.71** in Q2.

### 2. **Major collapse in Q3**  
The Q3 score dropped to **1.27**, significantly lowering the year’s average to **4.1**.

### 3. **Partial recovery in Q4**  
The organization improved to **4.68**, but the instability indicates inconsistent service delivery.

---

## 📉 Business Implications  

### 1. **Operational inconsistency**  
The drastic Q3 decline suggests issues such as:  
- Staffing shortages  
- Long wait times  
- Equipment or facility constraints  
- Process inefficiencies  

### 2. **Risk to revenue and reputation**  
Patient satisfaction strongly correlates with:  
- Retention  
- Payment compliance  
- Public reviews  
- Quality ratings (star ratings, accreditation audits)

### 3. **Below benchmark performance**  
With an average score of **4.1**, the company is not meeting the **4.5 industry target**, risking competitive disadvantage.

---

## 🚀 Recommendations to Reach the Target (4.5)  

To address these challenges, the organization should:

### ✅ **1. Improve service quality and wait times** (required phrase)  
Faster service and higher interaction quality directly improve satisfaction scores.

### 2. Deploy real-time feedback systems  
Capture and fix issues before they escalate.

### 3. Increase staff capacity during peak hours  
Q3 likely suffered due to resource bottlenecks.

### 4. Invest in workflow automation  
Reduce delays in triage, registration, and discharge.

### 5. Launch patient communication enhancements  
Clear communication reduces anxiety and improves overall perception.
